Please write a program that identifies the keys that match between two dataframes 
and returns a dictionary mapping of the keys.
The program should be able to handle multiple matches between the two dataframes. 
The program should also be able to handle the case where there are no matches between the two dataframes.
It should identify when there are leading zeros in the keys and match other potential columns that are missing the leading zeroes.
Not every value has to match between the two sets of columns.


# Create two sample dataframes
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'AwesomeBankid': ['1', '2', '5', '0'],
                    'name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe', 'Jill'],
                    'RandomName': ['5000', '70000', '35', '60000']},
                    'a4': ['0000XXYM', '0000AF2F', '0000AF2F', '0000FFF2']
                    )
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'uid': ['0', '2', '5', '2'],
                    'x2': ['XXYM', 'AF2F', 'AF2F', 'FFF2'],
                    'gender': ['M', 'F', 'M', 'F'],
                    'Ugh': ['5000', '60000', '70000', '80000']})


answer = {'AwesomeBankid': 'uid', 'a4': 'x2', 'RandomName': 'Ugh'}
